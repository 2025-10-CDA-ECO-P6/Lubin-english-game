## Project organisation

The project is organised in 5 main sections:

    - Welcome section: a presentation of the game and its objectives
    - First mission section: a self-assessment quiz to determine the player's level and role in the game
    - Store content section: a presentation of the different content available in the game and how to access it
    - Card section: a presentation of the different cards available in the game and how to use them
    - Project section: a presentation of the different projects available in the game and how to access them

## Technical choices

          The project is built with HTML and CSS. We used Sass for the CSS preprocessor. We also used Feather icons for the icons.

## Responsive strategy

    The project is designed to be responsive and accessible on different screen sizes. We used media queries to adapt
    the layout and the content to different screen sizes. We also used relative units for the font sizes and the spacing
    to ensure a good readability on different screen sizes.

## Future improvements

    - Add JS to make the game interactive
    - Add a backend to store the player's progress and the content of the game
    - Add schedule for the different missions and projects to create a more immersive experience
